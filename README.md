# Personal Portfolio Project Documentation

## 1. Audience

The project mandate was to design a portfolio website that would showcase our talent, abilities, coding experience and personalities to prospective employers. 

While I understand the importance of presenting myself professionally to the industry and prospective employers, I am also driven to find and connect with people that I enjoy being around. I value being part of something that is the right cultural fit for me, and firmly believe in finding a workplace that embraces authenticity. Having already spent many years in an industry full of people who felt the need to pretend to be someone they were not, I decided to design a portfolio website that would be infused with my values and personality: reflecting that I am someone who is hard-working, a fan of minimalism (and drinking games), and a team player with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour.

## 2. Design Decisions
The portfolio website went through multiple iterations, but stuck to the same theme of minimalism, clean lines, and simple, gender-neutral colours (grey, black, white and yellow).

I decided from the beginning to have a sticky navigation menu and a landing page. The initial graphic on the landing page was just a clean, minimalist stock image of a computer (see initial wireframe in section 4); but after further reflection, I decided that if I wanted to give users insight into who I am, it would be better to personalise the website with a photo of myself and a simple introduction to my background and current employment status.

## 3. Usability Heuristics
I considered the following usability heuristics:

### 1.	Visibility of System Status / Efficiency of Use
Given that the portfolio only consists of four simple pages that only take input from the user when they click on links, there was little need to show the user what was happening on the website, particularly given the load time was fast on both desktop and mobile. However, I did apply a hover effect over text links (the links being underlined and turning yellow), as well as the “Learn More” and “View Video” buttons (the buttons filling in yellow) so that the user would easily see what they were selecting, giving them instantaneous feedback.

### 2.	Match Between System and Real World 
The navigation bar appears in a logical, ordered manner (Home, About, Portfolio, Contact), using language that the user will readily understand. Similarly, the Portfolio page is divided into three, numbered sections: “01. Videography”, “02. Design”, and “03. Coding”, which follow a chronological order that users are familiar with. Finally, the Contact page uses rather informal, easy-to-digest language such as “Like what you see?” rather than the more traditional (and bland) “Contact”, appearing more natural and friendly.

### 3.	User Control and Freedom
The navigation menu was designed to be “sticky” – i.e. following the user as they scroll down the page. As a result, should the user have accidentally clicked on the wrong navigation link, they can easily find the correct one to select.

### 4.	Consistency and Standards / Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
The entire portfolio was premised upon clean, minimalist design principles and simple, fairly neutral colours (with the only popping colour being yellow). The focus of the design was on images, with brief explanations of the portfolio works.

### 5.	Error Prevention
The website was tested on multiple platforms including desktop and mobile.

## 4. Wireframes
I created an initial wireframe on desktop and mobile.

 
After further consideration, I decided to replace the header with the current image of myself, and have it stretch all the way to 100% of the screen width.

## 5. Style Guide
Navigation bar should use font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif. Main text heading should use font-family: 'Exo', sans-serif. Text (including the quotes) and buttons should be font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif.

Colours should be white (#FFFFFF), black (#000000), grey (#f8f8f8) and yellow (#ffd700). Yellow should be used minimally (for example, for the quotes section, and on hover for links or buttons).

## 6. Personal Logo
I initially planned my personal logo to be two overlapping Cs (my initials) that would look similar to arrows. Unfortunately, the design was a bit too sharp, and when a survey was done, the viewers did not realise they were C’s and instead thought they were diamonds (which was not the image I wanted to portray on the portfolio!). I decided to switch the direction of one of the Cs instead and make it look more like a C with an additional vertical line.

I picked the bronze/gold colour scheme (with variant shading) because I wanted something simple, elegant and interesting. Despite this, I was not particularly satisfied with this logo either, but given time constraints, I decided it would be sufficient.
